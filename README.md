Welcome to Project "Jungle Run".

https://thenumb.at/cpp-course/sdl2/01/vsSetup.html
You can see the link above but we have customized things differently. Let me guide you into the things we change:
  1. Platform: x64
  2. Change x86 -> x64.
2/. What is the meaning of bad ending, good ending and bad ending?
- Good Ending: Chris has collected all the gemstones, and when they are assembled, they emit a strong beam of light that illuminates the entire area. The Golem dissolves before the bright light, and the loop is broken, leaving Chris standing in front of the monument gate with the key to the treasure. Chris returns to the monument, attaches the gemstones to the chest, and finally obtains what he wanted. With the mission accomplished, Chris returns to rescue Claire, and the two siblings live a fulfilled life without having to part ways.
- True Ending: Chris runs to the end of the loop, where the Golem no longer pursues him. He jumps out of the loop and escapes. He has to run far away from the monument and plan how to get the gemstones. By chance, he meets a group of three people who express their interest in joining his plan. The group includes a female archaeologist who wants to explore the monument and uncover the truth about the treasure, a former soldier who follows with the mission to protect the archaeologist, and a mysterious man who only says he's here out of curiosity. With a common goal, Chris agrees to form a team, determined together to overcome the challenges of this strange forest area.
- Bad Ending: Chris thought he had died, but he suddenly wakes up at the starting point, and the Golem chases him once again. Chris keeps dying and coming back to life repeatedly until his spirit is completely shattered. He sinks deep into the never-ending loop.
